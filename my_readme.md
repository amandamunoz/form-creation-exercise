## Some meta notes:

I prioritized my time by focusing on getting the acceptance criteria working.

## If I had more time, some things I would consider:

- Styling:
  - Formatting the data on the page to match the mock-up
  - Making the image smaller
  - Generally revisiting the html/css structure to make it semantic and accessible
  - Generally making it look more like the mock up
- Validation - credit card info, address, positive numbers for tickets
- Safely rendering the html for description
